## What is generative AI?
- Understanding the fundamental concept behind generative AI and its role in artificial intelligence.

## Difference between generative and discriminative AI
- Exploring the distinction between generative models, which generate new data, and discriminative models, which classify input data into predefined categories.

## Types of generative models
- Learning about different approaches such as autoregressive models, variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and flow-based models.

## Applications of generative AI
- Discovering how generative AI is used in various fields including image generation, text generation, music generation, and more.

## Autoregressive models
- Understanding the concept of autoregressive models where the model predicts the next value in a sequence based on previous values.

## Variational autoencoders (VAEs)
- Exploring the architecture and training process of VAEs, which learn a latent representation of data and use it to generate new samples.

## Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
- Delving into the architecture and training dynamics of GANs, where a generator network learns to create data that is indistinguishable from real data, while a discriminator network learns to differentiate between real and generated data.

## Challenges in training generative models
- Investigating issues such as mode collapse, vanishing gradients, and training instability that are commonly encountered when training generative models.

## Evaluation of generative models
- Learning about metrics and techniques used to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated samples, such as Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and human evaluation.

## Advanced topics in generative AI
- Exploring recent advancements in the field, including self-attention mechanisms, multimodal generation, and applications in reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning.
