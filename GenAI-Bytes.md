## Gen AI Bytes
### Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Generative AI
- Machine Learning (ML): Uses algorithms to learn from data, improve over time; applications include recommendation systems and predictive analytics.
- Deep Learning (DL): Subset of ML using deep neural networks; excels in image/speech recognition and natural language processing.
- Generative AI: Creates new content (text, images, audio); uses techniques like GANs and transformers.

### What is Generative AI
- Focuses on generating new content (text, images, audio).
- Uses models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers.
- Applications include content creation, art generation, and synthetic data production.

### What is LLM
- Stands for Large Language Model.
- Trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.
- Examples include GPT-3 and BERT.

### What is Finetuning
- Process of training a pre-trained model on a specific task.
- Involves using a smaller dataset related to the target application.
- Enhances model performance for specialized tasks.

### What is RAG
- Stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- Combines retrieval of relevant documents with generative model outputs.
- Enhances accuracy and context-awareness in generated responses.

### What is Hallucination
- When an AI generates incorrect or nonsensical information.
- Common in language models when generating text.
- Can occur due to model overconfidence or lack of knowledge.

### What is Multimodality
- Integration of multiple types of data (e.g., text, images, audio).
- Enables models to understand and generate multi-faceted information.
- Examples include image captioning and video analysis.

### What is AI Agent
- Autonomous entity capable of performing tasks and making decisions.
- Uses AI techniques to perceive, reason, and act in its environment.
- Applications include virtual assistants, chatbots, and robotics.
